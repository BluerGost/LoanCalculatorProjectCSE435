# Loan Calculator Project CSE-435(Software Quality Assurance)

**Project Description**:<br>
The purpose of this project was to do unit testing on a real project and see how it practically works.
Because of this we first created a Loan Calculator which is able to do simple loan calculations and then made test classes and enough test cases to cover all the conditions. Since for unit testing using NUnit we need to call the operations using functions that's why the codes has been modified in a way that the test cases could be run. The unedited Project is available [HERE](https://github.com/BluerGost/LoanCalculatorProject). Note: *that that project might have gone through changes and could have more features compared to this one*.<br>
